Hi, I'm Jonas. I am starting as a research group leader in TÃ¼bingen, where I'm building a group for **safety- & efficiency- aligned learning** (ðŸ¦­). Before this, I've spent time at the University of Maryland and the University of Siegen.

I am mostly interested in questions of safety and efficiency in modern machine learning. There are a number of fundamental machine learning questions that come up in these  topics
that we still do not understand well -- such as the principles of data poisoning, the subtleties of water-marking for generative models,
privacy questions in federated learning, or adversarial attacks against large language models. Can we ever make these models "safe"? Is every language model API an invitation for the user to jailbreak it and do what they want?

Further, I am interested in questions about the efficiency of modern AI systems, especially for large language models. How efficient can we make these systems, can we train strong models with little compute? Can we extend the capabilities of language models with recursive computation? How do these questions impact the safety of these models?



In short:
* Safety, Security and Privacy in Machine Learning
* Efficient Machine Learning (especially for NLP)
* Trustworthy AI
* Deep Learning as-a-Science


###  Incoming PhD Students:

If you are interested in these topics, feel free to reach out for more information! I'm currently hiring through the following PhD programs:
* [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc)
* [Max Planck & ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS)](https://learning-systems.org/)
* [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)
