Based on a series of concrete examples, we discuss, categorize and systematize attacks that coerce varied unintended behaviors, such as misdirection, model control, denial-of-service, or data extraction. We analyze these attacks in controlled experiments, and find that many of them stem from the practice of pre-training LLMs with coding capabilities, as well as the continued existence of strange "glitch" tokens in common LLM vocabularies that should be removed for security reasons.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="hans_be_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Be like a Goldfish, Don’t Memorize!

To mitigate training data exposure without sacrificing model performance, we introduce a simple but subtle modification to the standard next-token prediction objective for autoregressive LLMs that we call the goldfish loss. During training, a fraction of the tokens in each training data sequence are excluded from the loss computation such that the model is not supervised to predict those tokens.

Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="jain_bring_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Bring Your Own Data!

For example, a company deploying a client-facing chatbot must ensure that the model will not respond to client requests with profanity. Current evaluations approach this problem using small, domain-specific datasets with human-curated labels. These evaluation sets are often sampled from a narrow and simplified distribution, and data sources can unknowingly be leaked into the training set. To alleviate these issues in traditional evaluation, we propose a complementary framework for additional self-sensitivity evaluation of LLMs by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Self-sensitivity evaluation can directly monitor LLM behavior on datasets collected in-the-wild or streamed during live model deployment. We demonstrate self-sensitivity evaluation strategies for measuring closed-book knowledge, toxicity, long-range context dependence, in addition to sensitivity to grammatical structure and tokenization errors. When comparisons to similar human-labeled benchmarks are available, we find strong correlations between self-sensitivity and human-supervised evaluations. The self-sensitivity paradigm complements current evaluation strategies that rely on labeled data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="kazemi_what_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">What Do We Learn from Inverting CLIP Models?</div> <div class="author"> Hamid Kazemi, Atoosa Chegini, <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, Soheil Feizi, and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tom Goldstein</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arxiv:2403.02580[cs]</em>, Mar 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We employ an inversion-based approach to examine CLIP models.

We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve performance even further. With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20 digit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems.

Although the two disciplines now come together under the overarching goal of AI risk management, they have historically evolved separately, giving rise to differing perspectives. Therefore, in this paper, we advocate that stakeholders in AI risk management should be aware of the nuances, synergies, and interplay between safety and security, and unambiguously take into account the perspectives of both disciplines in order to devise mostly effective and holistic risk mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, this vision is often obfuscated, as the definitions of the basic concepts of "safety" and "security" themselves are often inconsistent and lack consensus across communities. With AI risk management being increasingly cross-disciplinary, this issue is particularly salient. In light of this conceptual challenge, we introduce a unified reference framework to clarify the differences and interplay between AI safety and AI security, aiming to facilitate a shared understanding and effective collaboration across communities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="sharma_efficiently_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Efficiently Dispatching Flash Attention For Partially Filled Attention Masks</div> <div class="author"> Agniv Sharma, and <em>Jonas Geiping</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arxiv:2409.15097[cs]</em>, Sep 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Transformers are widely used across various applications, many of which yield sparse or partially filled attention matrices.

In this paper, we introduce Binary Block Masking, a highly efficient modification that enhances Flash Attention by making it mask-aware.

Some of these models are extended to caption videos as well. However, their capabilities to understand complex scenes are limited, and the descriptions they provide for scenes tend to be overly verbose and focused on the superficial appearance of objects. Scene descriptions, especially in movies, require a deeper contextual understanding, unlike general-purpose video captioning. To address this challenge, we propose a model, CALVIN, a specialized video LLM that leverages previous movie context to generate fully "contextual" scene descriptions. To achieve this, we train our model on a suite of tasks that integrate both image-based question-answering and video captioning within a unified framework, before applying instruction tuning to refine the model’s ability to provide scene captions.

Hence as their proliferation increases, it has become important to perform a database search to determine whether the properties of the image are attributable to specific training data, every time before a generated image is used for professional purposes. Existing tools for this purpose focus on retrieving images of similar semantic content. Meanwhile, many artists are concerned with style replication in text-to-image models. We present a framework for understanding and extracting style descriptors from images. Our framework comprises a new dataset curated using the insight that style is a subjective property of an image that captures complex yet meaningful interactions of factors including but not limited to colors, textures, shapes, etc. We also propose a method to extract style descriptors that can be used to attribute style of a generated image to the images used in the training dataset of a text-to-image model. We showcase promising results in various style retrieval tasks. We also quantitatively and qualitatively analyze style attribution and matching in the Stable Diffusion model.

As a result of this insecure curation pipeline, an adversary can poison or backdoor the resulting model by uploading malicious data to the internet and waiting for a victim to scrape and train on it. Existing approaches for creating poisons and backdoors start with randomly sampled clean data, called base samples, and then modify those samples to craft poisons. However, some base samples may be significantly more amenable to poisoning than others. As a result, we may be able to craft more potent poisons by carefully choosing the base samples. In this work, we use guided diffusion to synthesize base samples from scratch that lead to significantly more potent poisons and backdoors than previous state-of-the-art attacks. Our Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP) base samples can be combined with any downstream poisoning or backdoor attack to boost its effectiveness.

The widespread availability of foundation model checkpoints on the web poses considerable risks, including the vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we unveil a new vulnerability: the privacy backdoor attack. This black-box privacy attack aims to amplify the privacy leakage that arises when fine-tuning a model: when a victim fine-tunes a backdoored model, their training data will be leaked at a significantly higher rate than if they had fine-tuned a typical model. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and models, including both vision-language models (CLIP) and large language models, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of such an attack. Additionally, we carry out multiple ablation studies with different fine-tuning methods and inference strategies to thoroughly analyze this new threat.

In this paper, we observe experimentally that this implicit regularization behavior is {}em generic}, i.e. it does not depend strongly on the choice of optimizer. We demonstrate this by training neural networks using several gradient-free optimizers, which do not benefit from properties that are often attributed to gradient-based optimizers. This includes a guess-and-check optimizer that generates uniformly random parameter vectors until finding one that happens to achieve perfect train accuracy, and a zeroth-order Pattern Search optimizer that uses no gradient computations. In the low sample and few-shot regimes, where zeroth order optimizers are most computationally tractable, we find that these non-gradient optimizers achieve test accuracy comparable to SGD.

Attacks on language models have progressed from recovering single sentences in simple classification tasks to recovering larger parts of user data. Current attacks against federated language models are sequence-agnostic and aim to extract as much data as possible from an FL update - often at the expense of fidelity for any particular sequence. Because of this, current attacks fail to extract any meaningful data under large-scale aggregation. In realistic settings, an attacker cares most about a small portion of user data that contains sensitive personal information, for example sequences containing the phrase "my credit card number is ...". In this work, we propose the first attack on FL that achieves targeted extraction of sequences that contain privacy-critical phrases, whereby we employ maliciously modified parameters to allow the transformer itself to filter relevant sequences from aggregated user data and encode them in the gradient update.

We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, and which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, the attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text.

We investigate the downstream performance achievable with a transformer-based language model trained completely from scratch with masked language modeling for a single day on a single consumer GPU. Aside from re-analyzing nearly all components of the pretraining pipeline for this scenario and providing a modified pipeline with performance close to BERT, we investigate why scaling down is hard, and which modifications actually improve performance in this scenario. We provide evidence that even in this constrained setting, performance closely follows scaling laws observed in large-compute settings. Through the lens of scaling laws, we categorize a range of recent improvements to training and architecture and discuss their merit and practical applicability (or lack thereof) for the limited compute setting.

However, despite these advancements, several works in the existing literature have raised serious concerns about the potential misuse of LLMs such as spreading misinformation, generating fake news, plagiarism in academia, and contaminating the web. To address these concerns, a consensus among the research community is to develop algorithmic solutions to detect AI-generated text. The basic idea is that whenever we can tell if the given text is either written by a human or an AI, we can utilize this information to address the above-mentioned concerns. To that end, a plethora of detection frameworks have been proposed, highlighting the possibilities of AI-generated text detection. But in parallel to the development of detection frameworks, researchers have also concentrated on designing strategies to elude detection, i.e., focusing on the impossibilities of AI-generated text detection. This is a crucial step in order to make sure the detection frameworks are robust enough and it is not too easy to fool a detector. Despite the huge interest and the flurry of research in this domain, the community currently lacks a comprehensive analysis of recent developments. In this survey, we aim to provide a concise categorization and overview of current work encompassing both the prospects and the limitations of AI-generated text detection.

How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. Surprisingly, we find much more success with filtering and preprocessing than we would expect from other domains, such as vision, providing a first indication that the relative strengths of these defenses may be weighed differently in these domains.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="jain_neftune_2023-2" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">NEFTune: Noisy Embeddings Improve Instruction Finetuning</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://neelsjain.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Neel Jain</a>, Ping-yeh Chiang, <a href="https://yuxinwenrick.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yuxin Wen</a>, <a href="https://jwkirchenbauer.notion.site/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">John Kirchenbauer</a>, Hong-Min Chu, <a href="https://somepago.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gowthami Somepalli</a>, Brian R.

Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user’s needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a \1}mathrm{e}{-5} false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="kirchenbauer_watermark_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Watermark for Large Language Models</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://jwkirchenbauer.notion.site/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">John Kirchenbauer</a>, <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, <a href="https://yuxinwenrick.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yuxin Wen</a>, Jonathan Katz, Ian Miers, and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tom Goldstein</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning</em>, Jul 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of "green" tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="li_augmenters_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Augmenters at SemEval-2023 Task 1: Enhancing CLIP in Handling Compositionality and Ambiguity for Zero-Shot Visual WSD through Prompt Augmentation and Text-To-Image Diffusion</div> <div class="author"> Jie Li, Yow-Ting Shiue, Yong-Siang Shih, and <em>Jonas Geiping</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the The 17th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2023)</em>, Jul 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper describes our zero-shot approachesfor the Visual Word Sense Disambiguation(VWSD) Task in English.

First, it is widely believed that neural networks trained on unlearnable datasets only learn shortcuts, simpler rules that are not useful for generalization. In contrast, we find that networks actually can learn useful features that can be reweighed for high test performance, suggesting that image protection is not assured. Unlearnable datasets are also believed to induce learning shortcuts through linear separability of added perturbations. We provide a counterexample, demonstrating that linear separability of perturbations is not a necessary condition.

To achieve this goal, we propose }textit{AutoPoison}, an automated data poisoning pipeline. It naturally and coherently incorporates versatile attack goals into poisoned data with the help of an oracle LLM.

These approaches therefore come at a high computational cost, are memory intensive, and are hard to scale to large models or datasets. In this work, we focus on a minimalist baseline, utilizing the feature space of a backbone pretrained via self-supervised learning to perform data attribution. Our method is model-agnostic and scales easily to large datasets. We show results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, achieving strong performance that rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art approaches at a fraction of the compute or memory cost. Contrary to prior work, our results reinforce the intuition that a model’s prediction on one image is most impacted by visually similar training samples.

However, these systems can be influenced during training by malicious users who send poisoned updates. Because the training is decentralized and each user controls their own device, these users are free to poison the training protocol. In turn, this has lead to a number of proposals to incorporate aggregation strategies from byzantine-robust learning into the FL paradigm. Byzantine strategies are provably secure for simple model classes, and these robustness properties are often assumed to extend to neural models as well. In this work, we argue that a range of popular robust aggregation strategies, when applied to neural networks, can be trivially circumvented through simple adaptive attacks.

Unlike existing methods that perform post-hoc modifications to images after sampling, Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the entire sampling process, resulting in a model fingerprint that is invisible to humans. The watermark embeds a pattern into the initial noise vector used for sampling. These patterns are structured in Fourier space so that they are invariant to convolutions, crops, dilations, flips, and rotations. After image generation, the watermark signal is detected by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector, which is then checked for the embedded signal. We demonstrate that this technique can be easily applied to arbitrary diffusion models, including text-conditioned Stable Diffusion, as a plug-in with negligible loss in FID.

In this work, we propose a method to make network architectures provably invariant with respect to group actions by choosing one element from a (possibly continuous) orbit based on a fixed criterion. In a nutshell, we intend to ’undo’ any possible transformation before feeding the data into the actual network. Further, we empirically analyze the properties of different approaches which incorporate invariance via training or architecture, and demonstrate the advantages of our method in terms of robustness and computational efficiency.

The ability to swap the vocabulary of a model after it has been trained enables models to be adapted to different tokenizers, and even different languages, without the computational or data cost of from-scratch training. In this paper, we ask when such swaps are possible, and how to perform them effectively? The major challenge of performing a vocab swap is re-learning the parameters of the embedding layer for the vocabulary. We observe that it is possible to re-learn the embedding for a vocabulary using a naive initialization, and we investigate strong initialization strategies that enable learning of new embeddings for swapped vocabularies, even when those vocabularies come from a different source language than the original language model.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="ni_k-sam_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">K-SAM: Sharpness-Aware Minimization at the Speed of SGD</div> <div class="author"> Renkun Ni, Ping-yeh Chiang, <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, <a href="https://goldblum.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Micah Goldblum</a>, Andrew Gordon Wilson, and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tom Goldstein</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arxiv:2210.12864[cs]</em>, Oct 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as a robust technique for improving the accuracy of deep neural networks.

To address this challenge, we propose to compute gradients in both stages of SAM on only the top-k samples with highest loss.

Unfortunately, existing methods require knowledge of both the target architecture and the complete dataset so that a surrogate network can be trained, the parameters of which are used to generate the attack. In this work, we introduce autoregressive (AR) poisoning, a method that can generate poisoned data without access to the broader dataset. The proposed AR perturbations are generic, can be applied across different datasets, and can poison different architectures. Compared to existing unlearnable methods, our AR poisons are more resistant against common defenses such as adversarial training and strong data augmentations.

First, we find that poisons that reach a low training loss faster have lower peak test accuracy.

We introduce a new strategy that dramatically elevates existing attacks to operate on batches of arbitrarily large size, and without architectural modifications. Our model-agnostic strategy only requires modifications to the model parameters sent to the user, which is a realistic threat model in many scenarios.

These attacks can be provably deflected using differentially private (DP) training methods, although this comes with a sharp decrease in model performance. The InstaHide method has recently been proposed as an alternative to DP training that leverages supposed privacy properties of the mixup augmentation, although without rigorous guarantees. In this work, we show that strong data augmentations, such as mixup and random additive noise, nullify poison attacks while enduring only a small accuracy trade-off. To explain these finding, we propose a training method, DP-InstaHide, which combines the mixup regularizer with additive noise. A rigorous analysis of DP-InstaHide shows that mixup does indeed have privacy advantages, and that training with k-way mixup provably yields at least k times stronger DP guarantees than a naive DP mechanism. Because mixup (as opposed to noise) is beneficial to model performance, DP-InstaHide provides a mechanism for achieving stronger empirical performance against poisoning attacks than other known DP methods.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="borgnia_strong_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Strong Data Augmentation Sanitizes Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks Without an Accuracy Tradeoff</div> <div class="author"> Eitan Borgnia, Valeriia Cherepanova, Liam Fowl, Amin Ghiasi, <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, <a href="https://goldblum.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Micah Goldblum</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tom Goldstein</a>, and Arjun Gupta</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In ICASSP 2021 - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)</em>, Jun 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Data poisoning and backdoor attacks manipulate victim models by maliciously modifying training data.

We discuss spatial discretization of continuous partitioning problems into a graph structure, generalizing discretization onto a Cartesian grid. This setup allows us to faithfully work on super-pixel graphs constructed by SLIC or Cut-Pursuit, massively decreasing the computational effort for lifted partitioning problems compared to a Cartesian grid, while optimal energy values remain similar: The global matching is still solved near-globally optimal. We discuss this methodology in detail and show examples in multi-label segmentation by minimal partitions and stereo estimation, where we demonstrate that the proposed graph discretization can reduce runtime as well as memory consumption of convex relaxations of matching problems by up to a factor of 10.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="geiping_inverting_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Inverting Gradients - How Easy Is It to Break Privacy in Federated Learning?</div> <div class="author"> <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, Hartmut Bauermeister, Hannah Dröge, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michael Moeller</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems</em>, Dec 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="goldblum_truth_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Truth or Backpropaganda?

While they are interpretable and well-studied, their regularity assumptions are difficult to design by hand. Deep learning techniques on the other hand are purely data-driven, often provide excellent results, but are very difficult to constrain to predefined physical or safety-critical models. A possible combination between the two approaches is to design a parametric en- ergy and train the free parameters in such a way that minimizers of the energy correspond to desired solution on a set of training examples. Unfortunately, such formulations typically lead to bi-level optimization problems, on which common optimization algorithms are difficult to scale to modern requirements in data processing and efficiency. In this work, we present a new strategy to optimize these bi-level problems. We investigate surrogate single-level problems that majorize the target problems and can be implemented with existing tools, leading to efficient algorithms without collapse of the energy function. This framework of strategies enables new avenues to the training of parameterized energy minimization models from large data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="gorlitz_piecewise_2019-1" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Piecewise Rigid Scene Flow with Implicit Motion Segmentation</div> <div class="author"> Andreas Görlitz, <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, and Andreas Kolb</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</em>, Nov 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel variational approach to estimate the scene flow from RGB-D images. We regularize the ill-conditioned problem of scene flow estimation in a unified framework by enforcing piecewise rigid motion through decomposition into rotational and translational motion parts. Our model crucially regularizes these components by an L0 “norm”, thereby facilitating implicit motion segmentation in a joint energy minimization problem. Yet, we also show that this energy can be efficiently minimized by a proximal primal-dual algorithm. By implementing this approximate L0 rigid motion regularization, our scene flow estimation approach implicitly segments the observed scene of into regions of nearly constant rigid motion. We evaluate our joint scene flow and segmentation estimation approach on a variety of test scenarios, with and without ground truth data, and demonstrate that we outperform current scene flow techniques.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="geiping_composite_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Composite Optimization by Nonconvex Majorization-Minimization</div> <div class="author"> <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michael Moeller</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences</em>, Jan 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The minimization of a nonconvex composite function can model a variety of imaging tasks. A popular class of algorithms for solving such problems are majorization-minimization techniques which iteratively approximate the composite nonconvex function by a majorizing function that is easy to minimize. Most techniques, e.g., gradient descent, utilize convex majorizers in order to guarantee that the majorizer is easy to minimize. In our work we consider a natural class of nonconvex majorizers for these functions, and show that these majorizers are still sufficient for a globally convergent optimization scheme. Numerical results illustrate that by applying this scheme, one can often obtain superior local optima compared to previous majorization-minimization methods, when the nonconvex majorizers are solved to global optimality. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of our algorithm for depth superresolution from raw time-of-flight data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="geiping_multiframe_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Multiframe Motion Coupling for Video Super Resolution</div> <div class="author"> <em>Jonas Geiping</em>, Hendrik Dirks, Daniel Cremers, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michael Moeller</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Energy Minimization Methods in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</em>, Jan 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The idea of video super resolution is to use different view points of a single scene to enhance the overall resolution and quality. Classical energy minimization approaches first establish a correspondence of the current frame to all its neighbors in some radius and then use this temporal information for enhancement. In this paper, we propose the first variational super resolution approach that computes several super resolved frames in one batch optimization procedure by incorporating motion information between the high-resolution image frames themselves. As a consequence, the number of motion estimation problems grows linearly in the number of frames, opposed to a quadratic growth of classical methods and temporal consistency is enforced naturally.We use infimal convolution regularization as well as an automatic parameter balancing scheme to automatically determine the reliability of the motion information and reweight the regularization locally. We demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art results and even is competitive with machine learning approaches.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="geiping_image_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Image Analysis of Neural Tissue Development: Variational Methods for Segmentation and 3D-Reconstruction from Large Pinhole Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy</div> <div class="author"> <em>Jonas Alexander Geiping</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Westfälischen Wilhelms-Universität Münster</em>, Sep 2016 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Three-dimensional time series data from confocal fluorescence microscopes is a valuable tool in biological research, but the data is distorted by Poisson noise and defocus blur of varying axial extent. We seek to obtain structural information about the develop- ment of neural tissue from these images and define a segmentation by an appropriate thresholding of reconstructed data. We model the data degradation and develop a reconstruction formulation based on variational methods. Due to imprecise knowledge of the blur kernel we extend local sparsity regularization to a local patch and use this prior as additional regularization.
