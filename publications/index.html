            <p>Averaging checkpoints along the training trajectory is a simple yet powerful approach to improve the generalization performance of Machine Learning models and reduce training time. Motivated by these potential gains, and in an effort to fairly and thoroughly benchmark this technique, we present an extensive evaluation of averaging techniques in modern Deep Learning, which we perform using AlgoPerf }citep{dahl_benchmarking_2023}, a large-scale benchmark for optimization algorithms. We investigate whether weight averaging can reduce training time, improve generalization, and replace learning rate decay, as suggested by recent literature. Our evaluation across seven architectures and datasets reveals that averaging significantly accelerates training and yields considerable efficiency gains, at the price of a minimal implementation and memory cost, while mildly improving generalization across all considered workloads. Finally, we explore the relationship between averaging and learning rate annealing and show how to optimally combine the two to achieve the best performances.</p>

            <p>Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate. However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model’s free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice–but, we show that this has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models–even small ones–achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading. Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.</p>

            <p>The indistinguishability of AI-generated content from human text raises challenges in transparency and accountability. While several methods exist to watermark models behind APIs, embedding watermark strategies directly into model weights that are later reflected in the outputs of the model is challenging. In this study we propose a strategy to finetune a pair of low-rank adapters of a model, one serving as the text-generating model, and the other as the detector, so that a subtle watermark is embedded into the text generated by the first model and simultaneously optimized for detectability by the second. In this way, the watermarking strategy is fully learned end-to-end. This process imposes an optimization challenge, as balancing watermark robustness, naturalness, and task performance requires trade-offs. We discuss strategies on how to optimize this min-max objective and present results showing the effect of this modification to instruction finetuning.</p>

            <p>We study a novel language model architecture that is capable of scaling test-time computation by implicitly reasoning in latent space. Our model works by iterating a recurrent block, thereby unrolling to arbitrary depth at test-time. This stands in contrast to mainstream reasoning models that scale up compute by producing more tokens. Unlike approaches based on chain-of-thought, our approach does not require any specialized training data, can work with small context windows, and can capture types of reasoning that are not easily represented in words. We scale a proof-of-concept model to 3.5 billion parameters and 800 billion tokens. We show that the resulting model can improve its performance on reasoning benchmarks, sometimes dramatically, up to a computation load equivalent to 50 billion parameters.</p>

            <p>As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as "AI Oversight". We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing a probabilistic metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using this metric, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from "weak-to-strong generalization". As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight. However, we observe a concerning trend – model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.</p>

            <p>Automatically generated passwords and passphrases are a cornerstone of IT security. Yet, these passphrases are often hard to remember and see only limited adoption. In this work, we use large language models to generate passphrases with rigorous security guarantees via the computation of the entropy of the output as a metric of the security of the passphrase. We then present a range of practical methods to generate language model outputs with sufficient entropy: raising entropy through in-context examples and generation through a new top-q truncation method. We further verify the influence of prompt construction in steering the output topic and grammatical structure. Finally, we conduct user studies to determine the adoption rates for these LLM-generated passphrases in practice.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to forecasting tasks, with some works claiming these systems match or exceed human performance. In this paper, we argue that, as a community, we should be careful about such conclusions as evaluating LLM forecasters presents unique challenges. We identify two broad categories of issues: (1) difficulty in trusting evaluation results due to many forms of temporal leakage, and (2) difficulty in extrapolating from evaluation performance to real-world forecasting. Through systematic analysis and concrete examples from prior work, we demonstrate how evaluation flaws can raise concerns about current and future performance claims. We argue that more rigorous evaluation methodologies are needed to confidently assess the forecasting abilities of LLMs.</p>

            <p>As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target’s capability exceeds the attacker’s, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models’ persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.</p>

            <p>There is growing excitement about the potential of Language Models (LMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. Falsifying hypotheses is key to scientific progress, as it allows claims to be iteratively refined over time. This process requires significant researcher effort, reasoning, and ingenuity. Yet current benchmarks for LMs predominantly assess their ability to generate solutions rather than challenge them. We advocate for developing benchmarks that evaluate this inverse capability - creating counterexamples for subtly incorrect solutions. To demonstrate this approach, we start with the domain of algorithmic problem solving, where counterexamples can be evaluated automatically using code execution. Specifically, we introduce REFUTE, a dynamically updating benchmark that includes recent problems and incorrect submissions from programming competitions, where human experts successfully identified counterexamples. Our analysis finds that the best reasoning agents, even OpenAI o3-mini (high) with code execution feedback, can create counterexamples for only &lt;9% of incorrect solutions in REFUTE, even though ratings indicate its ability to solve up to 48% of these problems from scratch. We hope our work spurs progress in evaluating and enhancing LMs’ ability to falsify incorrect solutions - a capability that is crucial for both accelerating research and making models self-improve through reliable reflective reasoning.</p>

            <p>Adam is known to perform significantly better than Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in language models, a phenomenon for which a number of explanations have been proposed. In this work, we revisit this "optimizer gap" through a series of comprehensively tuned baseline training runs for language modeling with Transformers. We exhaustively study how momentum, gradient clipping, and batch size affect the gap between SGD and Adam. Our empirical findings show that SGD with momentum can actually perform similarly to Adam in small-batch settings, if tuned correctly. We revisit existing explanations for Adam’s advantage, including heavy-tailed class imbalance, directional sharpness, and Hessian heterogeneity, which struggle to directly explain this phenomenon. Towards bridging this gap in our understanding, by analyzing our Transformer training runs and simple quadratic settings inspired by the literature, we provide new insights, driven by stochastic differential equation models, into the role of batch size on the training dynamics.</p>

            <p>Reasoning capabilities represent a critical frontier for large language models (LLMs), but developing them requires extensive proprietary datasets and computational resources. One way to efficiently supplement capabilities with is by model merging, which offers a promising alternative by combining multiple models without retraining. However, current merging approaches rely on manually-designed strategies for merging hyperparameters, limiting the exploration of potential model combinations and requiring significant human effort. We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks. Effective merges are found with limited compute, e.g. within less than 500 search steps.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model’s abilities by aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2) Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning, for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain approximately 97.3}% of the original performance while removing {}sim25}% of parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

            <p>A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful responses from safety-tuned LLMs. In their original settings, these methods all largely succeed in coercing the target output, but their attacks vary substantially in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model combines constraints in perplexity, measuring how far a jailbreak deviates from natural text, and computational budget, in total FLOPs. For the former, we build an N-gram model on 1T tokens, which, in contrast to model-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic and inherently interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this new, realistic threat model, with which we, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing. After a rigorous comparison, we not only find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern models to be lower than previously presented but also find that attacks based on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent N-grams, either selecting N-grams absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g. specific to code datasets.</p>

            <p>It has recently been shown that adversarial attacks on large language models (LLMs) can "jailbreak" the model into making harmful statements. In this work, we argue that the spectrum of adversarial attacks on LLMs is much larger than merely jailbreaking. We provide a broad overview of possible attack surfaces and attack goals. Based on a series of concrete examples, we discuss, categorize and systematize attacks that coerce varied unintended behaviors, such as misdirection, model control, denial-of-service, or data extraction. We analyze these attacks in controlled experiments, and find that many of them stem from the practice of pre-training LLMs with coding capabilities, as well as the continued existence of strange "glitch" tokens in common LLM vocabularies that should be removed for security reasons.</p>

            <p>A growing body of work has shown that large language models memorize a portion of their training data and can reproduce this training data verbatim at inference time. This observation has become a key issue for the community as it poses major privacy risks for data owners, and exposes companies to legal risks of copyright infringement claims. To mitigate training data exposure without sacrificing model performance, we introduce a simple but subtle modification to the standard next-token prediction objective for autoregressive LLMs that we call the goldfish loss. During training, a fraction of the tokens in each training data sequence are excluded from the loss computation such that the model is not supervised to predict those tokens. Later, when generating text autoregressively, these dropped tokens inhibit the verbatim reproduction of the complete chain of tokens in the training sequence. We run extensive experiments training billion-scale parameter Llama-2 models trained from scratch and demonstrate significant reductions in extractable sequences with little to no impact on validation perplexity or downstream benchmarks.</p>

However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.</p>

            <p>With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ubiquitous deployment in diverse domains, measuring language model behavior on realistic data is imperative. For example, a company deploying a client-facing chatbot must ensure that the model will not respond to client requests with profanity. Current evaluations approach this problem using small, domain-specific datasets with human-curated labels. These evaluation sets are often sampled from a narrow and simplified distribution, and data sources can unknowingly be leaked into the training set. To alleviate these issues in traditional evaluation, we propose a complementary framework for additional self-sensitivity evaluation of LLMs by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Self-sensitivity evaluation can directly monitor LLM behavior on datasets collected in-the-wild or streamed during live model deployment. We demonstrate self-sensitivity evaluation strategies for measuring closed-book knowledge, toxicity, long-range context dependence, in addition to sensitivity to grammatical structure and tokenization errors. When comparisons to similar human-labeled benchmarks are available, we find strong correlations between self-sensitivity and human-supervised evaluations. The self-sensitivity paradigm complements current evaluation strategies that rely on labeled data.</p>

            <p>We employ an inversion-based approach to examine CLIP models. Our examination reveals that inverting CLIP models results in the generation of images that exhibit semantic alignment with the specified target prompts. We leverage these inverted images to gain insights into various aspects of CLIP models, such as their ability to blend concepts and inclusion of gender biases. We notably observe instances of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) images during model inversion. This phenomenon occurs even for semantically innocuous prompts, like "a beautiful landscape," as well as for prompts involving the names of celebrities.</p>

            <p>We develop a methodology for analyzing language model task performance at the individual example level based on training data density estimation. Experiments with paraphrasing as a controlled intervention on finetuning data demonstrate that increasing the support in the training distribution for specific test queries results in a measurable increase in density, which is also a significant predictor of the performance increase caused by the intervention. Experiments with pretraining data demonstrate that we can explain a significant fraction of the variance in model perplexity via density measurements. We conclude that our framework can provide statistical evidence of the dependence of a target model’s predictions on subsets of its training data, and can more generally be used to characterize the support (or lack thereof) in the training data for a given test task.</p>

            <p>The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in large part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each digit inside of a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve performance even further. With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20 digit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems. Finally, we show that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other multi-step reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.</p>

            <p>The exposure of security vulnerabilities in safety-aligned language models, e.g., susceptibility to adversarial attacks, has shed light on the intricate interplay between AI safety and AI security. Although the two disciplines now come together under the overarching goal of AI risk management, they have historically evolved separately, giving rise to differing perspectives. Therefore, in this paper, we advocate that stakeholders in AI risk management should be aware of the nuances, synergies, and interplay between safety and security, and unambiguously take into account the perspectives of both disciplines in order to devise mostly effective and holistic risk mitigation approaches. Unfortunately, this vision is often obfuscated, as the definitions of the basic concepts of "safety" and "security" themselves are often inconsistent and lack consensus across communities. With AI risk management being increasingly cross-disciplinary, this issue is particularly salient. In light of this conceptual challenge, we introduce a unified reference framework to clarify the differences and interplay between AI safety and AI security, aiming to facilitate a shared understanding and effective collaboration across communities.</p>

            <p>Being able to reconstruct training data from the parameters of a neural network is a major privacy concern. Previous works have shown that reconstructing training data, under certain circumstances, is possible. In this work, we analyse such reconstructions empirically and propose a new formulation of the reconstruction as a solution to a bilevel optimisation problem. We demonstrate that our formulation as well as previous approaches highly depend on the initialisation of the training images \x to reconstruct. In particular, we show that a random initialisation of \x can lead to reconstructions that resemble valid training samples while not being part of the actual training dataset. Thus, our experiments on affine and one-hidden layer networks suggest that when reconstructing natural images, yet an adversary cannot identify whether reconstructed images have indeed been part of the set of training samples.</p>

            <p>Transformers are widely used across various applications, many of which yield sparse or partially filled attention matrices. Examples include attention masks designed to reduce the quadratic complexity of attention, sequence packing techniques, and recent innovations like tree masking for fast validation in MEDUSA. Despite the inherent sparsity in these matrices, the state-of-the-art algorithm Flash Attention still processes them with quadratic complexity as though they were dense. In this paper, we introduce Binary Block Masking, a highly efficient modification that enhances Flash Attention by making it mask-aware. We further propose two optimizations: one tailored for masks with contiguous non-zero patterns and another for extremely sparse masks. Our experiments on attention masks derived from real-world scenarios demonstrate up to a 9x runtime improvement. The implementation will be publicly released to foster further research and application.</p>

            <p>Training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters requires tens of thousands of GPUs, and a highly scalable software stack. In this work, we present a novel four-dimensional hybrid parallel algorithm implemented in a highly scalable, portable, open-source framework called AxoNN. We describe several performance optimizations in AxoNN to improve matrix multiply kernel performance, overlap non-blocking collectives with computation, and performance modeling to choose performance optimal configurations. These have resulted in unprecedented scaling and peak flop/s (bf16) for training of GPT-style transformer models on Perlmutter (620.1 Petaflop/s), Frontier (1.381 Exaflop/s) and Alps (1.423 Exaflop/s). While the abilities of LLMs improve with the number of trainable parameters, so do privacy and copyright risks caused by memorization of training data, which can cause disclosure of sensitive or private information at inference time. We highlight this side effect of scale through experiments that explore “catastrophic memorization,” where models are sufficiently large to memorize training data in a single pass, and present an approach to prevent it. As part of this study, we demonstrate fine-tuning of a 405-billion parameter LLM using AxoNN on Frontier.</p>

            <p>The recent emergence of powerful Vision-Language models (VLMs) has significantly improved image captioning. Some of these models are extended to caption videos as well. However, their capabilities to understand complex scenes are limited, and the descriptions they provide for scenes tend to be overly verbose and focused on the superficial appearance of objects. Scene descriptions, especially in movies, require a deeper contextual understanding, unlike general-purpose video captioning. To address this challenge, we propose a model, CALVIN, a specialized video LLM that leverages previous movie context to generate fully "contextual" scene descriptions. To achieve this, we train our model on a suite of tasks that integrate both image-based question-answering and video captioning within a unified framework, before applying instruction tuning to refine the model’s ability to provide scene captions. Lastly, we observe that our model responds well to prompt engineering and few-shot in-context learning techniques, enabling the user to adapt it to any new movie with very little additional annotation.</p>

            <p>Generative models are now widely used by graphic designers and artists. Prior works have shown that these models remember and often replicate content from their training data during generation. Hence as their proliferation increases, it has become important to perform a database search to determine whether the properties of the image are attributable to specific training data, every time before a generated image is used for professional purposes. Existing tools for this purpose focus on retrieving images of similar semantic content. Meanwhile, many artists are concerned with style replication in text-to-image models. We present a framework for understanding and extracting style descriptors from images. Our framework comprises a new dataset curated using the insight that style is a subjective property of an image that captures complex yet meaningful interactions of factors including but not limited to colors, textures, shapes, etc. We also propose a method to extract style descriptors that can be used to attribute style of a generated image to the images used in the training dataset of a text-to-image model. We showcase promising results in various style retrieval tasks. We also quantitatively and qualitatively analyze style attribution and matching in the Stable Diffusion model.

            <p>Modern neural networks are often trained on massive datasets that are web scraped with minimal human inspection. As a result of this insecure curation pipeline, an adversary can poison or backdoor the resulting model by uploading malicious data to the internet and waiting for a victim to scrape and train on it. Existing approaches for creating poisons and backdoors start with randomly sampled clean data, called base samples, and then modify those samples to craft poisons. However, some base samples may be significantly more amenable to poisoning than others. As a result, we may be able to craft more potent poisons by carefully choosing the base samples. In this work, we use guided diffusion to synthesize base samples from scratch that lead to significantly more potent poisons and backdoors than previous state-of-the-art attacks. Our Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP) base samples can be combined with any downstream poisoning or backdoor attack to boost its effectiveness. Our implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hsouri/GDP .</p>

            <p>It is commonplace to produce application-specific models by fine-tuning large pre-trained models using a small bespoke dataset. The widespread availability of foundation model checkpoints on the web poses considerable risks, including the vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we unveil a new vulnerability: the privacy backdoor attack. This black-box privacy attack aims to amplify the privacy leakage that arises when fine-tuning a model: when a victim fine-tunes a backdoored model, their training data will be leaked at a significantly higher rate than if they had fine-tuned a typical model. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and models, including both vision-language models (CLIP) and large language models, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of such an attack. Additionally, we carry out multiple ablation studies with different fine-tuning methods and inference strategies to thoroughly analyze this new threat. Our findings highlight a critical privacy concern within the machine learning community and call for a re-evaluation of safety protocols in the use of open-source pre-trained models.</p>

            <p>Self-supervised learning, dubbed the dark matter of intelligence, is a promising path to advance machine learning. Yet, much like cooking, training SSL methods is a delicate art with a high barrier to entry. While many components are familiar, successfully training a SSL method involves a dizzying set of choices from the pretext tasks to training hyper-parameters. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry into SSL research by laying the foundations and latest SSL recipes in the style of a cookbook. We hope to empower the curious researcher to navigate the terrain of methods, understand the role of the various knobs, and gain the know-how required to explore how delicious SSL can be.</p>

            <p>Standard diffusion models involve an image transform – adding Gaussian noise – and an image restoration operator that inverts this degradation. We observe that the generative behavior of diffusion models is not strongly dependent on the choice of image degradation, and in fact, an entire family of generative models can be constructed by varying this choice. Even when using completely deterministic degradations (e.g., blur, masking, and more), the training and test-time update rules that underlie diffusion models can be easily generalized to create generative models. The success of these fully deterministic models calls into question the community’s understanding of diffusion models, which relies on noise in either gradient Langevin dynamics or variational inference and paves the way for generalized diffusion models that invert arbitrary processes.</p>

            <p>Academic tabular benchmarks often contain small sets of curated features. In contrast, data scientists typically collect as many features as possible into their datasets, and even engineer new features from existing ones. To prevent over-fitting in subsequent downstream modeling, practitioners commonly use automated feature selection methods that identify a reduced subset of informative features. Existing benchmarks for tabular feature selection consider classical downstream models, toy synthetic datasets, or do not evaluate feature selectors on the basis of downstream performance. We construct a challenging feature selection benchmark evaluated on downstream neural networks including transformers, using real datasets and multiple methods for generating extraneous features. We also propose an input-gradient-based analogue of LASSO for neural networks that outperforms classical feature selection methods on challenging problems such as selecting from corrupted or second-order features.</p>

            <p>It is commonly believed that the implicit regularization of optimizers is needed for neural networks to generalize in the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we observe experimentally that this implicit regularization behavior is {}em generic}, i.e. it does not depend strongly on the choice of optimizer. We demonstrate this by training neural networks using several gradient-free optimizers, which do not benefit from properties that are often attributed to gradient-based optimizers. This includes a guess-and-check optimizer that generates uniformly random parameter vectors until finding one that happens to achieve perfect train accuracy, and a zeroth-order Pattern Search optimizer that uses no gradient computations. In the low sample and few-shot regimes, where zeroth order optimizers are most computationally tractable, we find that these non-gradient optimizers achieve test accuracy comparable to SGD.

            <p>As federated learning (FL) matures, privacy attacks against FL systems in turn become more numerous and complex. Attacks on language models have progressed from recovering single sentences in simple classification tasks to recovering larger parts of user data. Current attacks against federated language models are sequence-agnostic and aim to extract as much data as possible from an FL update - often at the expense of fidelity for any particular sequence. Because of this, current attacks fail to extract any meaningful data under large-scale aggregation. In realistic settings, an attacker cares most about a small portion of user data that contains sensitive personal information, for example sequences containing the phrase "my credit card number is ...". In this work, we propose the first attack on FL that achieves targeted extraction of sequences that contain privacy-critical phrases, whereby we employ maliciously modified parameters to allow the transformer itself to filter relevant sequences from aggregated user data and encode them in the gradient update. Our attack can effectively extract sequences of interest even against extremely large-scale aggregation.</p>

            <p>A central tenet of Federated learning (FL), which trains models without centralizing user data, is privacy. However, previous work has shown that the gradient updates used in FL can leak user information. While the most industrial uses of FL are for text applications (e.g. keystroke prediction), nearly all attacks on FL privacy have focused on simple image classifiers. We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, and which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, the attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text. This work suggests that FL on text, which has historically been resistant to privacy attacks, is far more vulnerable than previously thought.</p>

            <p>Recent trends in language modeling have focused on increasing performance through scaling, and have resulted in an environment where training language models is out of reach for most researchers and practitioners. While most in the community are asking how to push the limits of extreme computation, we ask the opposite question: How far can we get with a single GPU in just one day? We investigate the downstream performance achievable with a transformer-based language model trained completely from scratch with masked language modeling for a single day on a single consumer GPU. Aside from re-analyzing nearly all components of the pretraining pipeline for this scenario and providing a modified pipeline with performance close to BERT, we investigate why scaling down is hard, and which modifications actually improve performance in this scenario. We provide evidence that even in this constrained setting, performance closely follows scaling laws observed in large-compute settings. Through the lens of scaling laws, we categorize a range of recent improvements to training and architecture and discuss their merit and practical applicability (or lack thereof) for the limited compute setting. We provide code to reproduce all experiments at github.com/JonasGeiping/cramming .</p>

            <p>Despite the clear performance benefits of data augmentations, little is known about why they are so effective. In this paper, we disentangle several key mechanisms through which data augmentations operate. Establishing an exchange rate between augmented and additional real data, we find that in out-of-distribution testing scenarios, augmentations which yield samples that are diverse, but inconsistent with the data distribution can be even more valuable than additional training data. Moreover, we find that data augmentations which encourage invariances can be more valuable than invariance alone, especially on small and medium sized training sets. Following this observation, we show that augmentations induce additional stochasticity during training, effectively flattening the loss landscape.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the domain of natural language processing (NLP) with remarkable capabilities of generating human-like text responses. However, despite these advancements, several works in the existing literature have raised serious concerns about the potential misuse of LLMs such as spreading misinformation, generating fake news, plagiarism in academia, and contaminating the web. To address these concerns, a consensus among the research community is to develop algorithmic solutions to detect AI-generated text. The basic idea is that whenever we can tell if the given text is either written by a human or an AI, we can utilize this information to address the above-mentioned concerns. To that end, a plethora of detection frameworks have been proposed, highlighting the possibilities of AI-generated text detection. But in parallel to the development of detection frameworks, researchers have also concentrated on designing strategies to elude detection, i.e., focusing on the impossibilities of AI-generated text detection. This is a crucial step in order to make sure the detection frameworks are robust enough and it is not too easy to fool a detector. Despite the huge interest and the flurry of research in this domain, the community currently lacks a comprehensive analysis of recent developments. In this survey, we aim to provide a concise categorization and overview of current work encompassing both the prospects and the limitations of AI-generated text detection. To enrich the collective knowledge, we engage in an exhaustive discussion on critical and challenging open questions related to ongoing research on AI-generated text detection.</p>

            <p>As Large Language Models quickly become ubiquitous, their security vulnerabilities are critical to understand. Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. Surprisingly, we find much more success with filtering and preprocessing than we would expect from other domains, such as vision, providing a first indication that the relative strengths of these defenses may be weighed differently in these domains.</p>

            <p>As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood the internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. _Watermarking_ is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user’s needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a \1}mathrm{e}{-5} false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.</p>

            <p>Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of "green" tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.</p>

We find that the CLIP textencoder may have limited abilities in captur-ing the compositionality in natural language.Conversely, the descriptive focus of the phrasevaries from instance to instance. We addressthese issues in our two systems, Augment-CLIPand Stable Diffusion Sampling (SD Sampling).Augment-CLIP augments the text prompt bygenerating sentences that contain the contextphrase with the help of large language mod-els (LLMs). We further explore CLIP modelsin other languages, as the an ambiguous wordmay be translated into an unambiguous one inthe other language. SD Sampling uses text-to-image Stable Diffusion to generate multipleimages from the given phrase, increasing thelikelihood that a subset of images match theone that paired with the text.</p>

            <p>Differentiable architecture search (DAS) is a widely researched tool for the design of novel architectures. The main benefit of DAS is the effectiveness achieved through the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture search. In this work, we investigate DAS in a systematic case study of inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a controlled manner. We demonstrate that the success of DAS can be extended from image classification to signal reconstruction, in principle. However, our experiments also expose three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DAS-based methods in inverse problems: First, the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final performance is strongly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. While the results on image reconstruction confirm the potential of the DAS paradigm, they challenge the common understanding of DAS as a one-shot method.</p>

            <p>Recently developed text-to-image diffusion models make it easy to edit or create high-quality images. Their ease of use has raised concerns about the potential for malicious editing or deepfake creation. Imperceptible perturbations have been proposed as a means of protecting images from malicious editing by preventing diffusion models from generating realistic images. However, we find that the aforementioned perturbations are not robust to JPEG compression, which poses a major weakness because of the common usage and availability of JPEG. We discuss the importance of robustness for additive imperceptible perturbations and encourage alternative approaches to protect images against editing.</p>

            <p>In an era of widespread web scraping, unlearnable dataset methods have the potential to protect data privacy by preventing deep neural networks from generalizing. But in addition to a number of practical limitations that make their use unlikely, we make a number of findings that call into question their ability to safeguard data. First, it is widely believed that neural networks trained on unlearnable datasets only learn shortcuts, simpler rules that are not useful for generalization. In contrast, we find that networks actually can learn useful features that can be reweighed for high test performance, suggesting that image protection is not assured. Unlearnable datasets are also believed to induce learning shortcuts through linear separability of added perturbations. We provide a counterexample, demonstrating that linear separability of perturbations is not a necessary condition. To emphasize why linearly separable perturbations should not be relied upon, we propose an orthogonal projection attack which allows learning from unlearnable datasets published in ICML 2021 and ICLR 2023. Our proposed attack is significantly less complex than recently proposed techniques.</p>

            <p>Instruction tuning is an effective technique to align large language models (LLMs) with human intent. In this work, we investigate how an adversary can exploit instruction tuning by injecting specific instruction-following examples into the training data that intentionally changes the model’s behavior. For example, an adversary can achieve content injection by injecting training examples that mention target content and eliciting such behavior from downstream models. To achieve this goal, we propose }textit{AutoPoison}, an automated data poisoning pipeline. It naturally and coherently incorporates versatile attack goals into poisoned data with the help of an oracle LLM. We showcase two example attacks: content injection and over-refusal attacks, each aiming to induce a specific exploitable behavior. We quantify and benchmark the strength and the stealthiness of our data poisoning scheme. Our results show that AutoPoison allows an adversary to change a model’s behavior by poisoning only a small fraction of data while maintaining a high level of stealthiness in the poisoned examples. We hope our work sheds light on how data quality affects the behavior of instruction-tuned models and raises awareness of the importance of data quality for responsible deployments of LLMs.</p>

            <p>Data attribution methods play a crucial role in understanding machine learning models, providing insight into which training data points are most responsible for model outputs during deployment. However, current state-of-the-art approaches require a large ensemble of as many as 300,000 models to accurately attribute model predictions. These approaches therefore come at a high computational cost, are memory intensive, and are hard to scale to large models or datasets. In this work, we focus on a minimalist baseline, utilizing the feature space of a backbone pretrained via self-supervised learning to perform data attribution. Our method is model-agnostic and scales easily to large datasets. We show results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, achieving strong performance that rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art approaches at a fraction of the compute or memory cost. Contrary to prior work, our results reinforce the intuition that a model’s prediction on one image is most impacted by visually similar training samples. Our approach serves as a simple and efficient baseline for data attribution on images.</p>

            <p>Images generated by diffusion models like Stable Diffusion are increasingly widespread. Recent works and even lawsuits have shown that these models are prone to replicating their training data, unbeknownst to the user. In this paper, we first analyze this memorization problem in text-to-image diffusion models. While it is widely believed that duplicated images in the training set are responsible for content replication at inference time, we observe that the text conditioning of the model plays a similarly important role. In fact, we see in our experiments that data replication often does not happen for unconditional models, while it is common in the text-conditional case. Motivated by our findings, we then propose several techniques for reducing data replication at both training and inference time by randomizing and augmenting image captions in the training set.

            <p>As industrial applications are increasingly automated by machine learning models, enforcing personal data ownership and intellectual property rights requires tracing training data back to their rightful owners. Membership inference algorithms approach this problem by using statistical techniques to discern whether a target sample was included in a model’s training set. However, existing methods only utilize the unaltered target sample or simple augmentations of the target to compute statistics. Such a sparse sampling of the model’s behavior carries little information, leading to poor inference capabilities. In this work, we use adversarial tools to directly optimize for queries that are discriminative and diverse. Our improvements achieve significantly more accurate membership inference than existing methods, especially in offline scenarios and in the low false-positive regime which is critical in legal settings.</p>

            <p>The strength of modern generative models lies in their ability to be controlled through prompts. Hard prompts comprise interpretable words and tokens, and are typically hand-crafted by humans. Soft prompts, on the other hand, consist of continuous feature vectors. These can be discovered using powerful optimization methods, but they cannot be easily edited, re-used across models, or plugged into a text-based interface. We describe an easy-to-use approach to automatically optimize hard text prompts through efficient gradient-based optimization. Our approach can be readily applied to text-to-image and text-only applications alike. This method allows API users to easily generate, discover, and mix and match image concepts without prior knowledge of how to prompt the model. Furthermore, using our method, we can bypass token-level content filters imposed by Midjourney by optimizing through the open-sourced text encoder.</p>

            <p>Decentralized training of machine learning models, for instance with federated learning protocols, continues to diffuse from theory toward practical applications and use cases. In federated learning (FL), a central server trains a model collaboratively with a group of users by communicating model updates, without the exchange of private user information. However, these systems can be influenced during training by malicious users who send poisoned updates. Because the training is decentralized and each user controls their own device, these users are free to poison the training protocol. In turn, this has lead to a number of proposals to incorporate aggregation strategies from byzantine-robust learning into the FL paradigm. Byzantine strategies are provably secure for simple model classes, and these robustness properties are often assumed to extend to neural models as well. In this work, we argue that a range of popular robust aggregation strategies, when applied to neural networks, can be trivially circumvented through simple adaptive attacks. We discuss the intuitions behind these adaptive attacks, and show that, despite their simplicity, they provide strong baselines that lead to significant decreases in model performance in FL systems.</p>

            <p>Watermarking the outputs of generative models is a crucial technique for tracing copyright and preventing potential harm from AI-generated content. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called Tree-Ring Watermarking that robustly fingerprints diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing methods that perform post-hoc modifications to images after sampling, Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the entire sampling process, resulting in a model fingerprint that is invisible to humans. The watermark embeds a pattern into the initial noise vector used for sampling. These patterns are structured in Fourier space so that they are invariant to convolutions, crops, dilations, flips, and rotations. After image generation, the watermark signal is detected by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector, which is then checked for the embedded signal. We demonstrate that this technique can be easily applied to arbitrary diffusion models, including text-conditioned Stable Diffusion, as a plug-in with negligible loss in FID. Our watermark is semantically hidden in the image space and is far more robust than watermarking alternatives that are currently deployed.</p>

            <p>Many applications require robustness, or ideally invariance, of neural networks to certain transformations of input data. Most commonly, this requirement is addressed by training data augmentation, using adversarial training, or defining network architectures that include the desired invariance by design. In this work, we propose a method to make network architectures provably invariant with respect to group actions by choosing one element from a (possibly continuous) orbit based on a fixed criterion. In a nutshell, we intend to ’undo’ any possible transformation before feeding the data into the actual network. Further, we empirically analyze the properties of different approaches which incorporate invariance via training or architecture, and demonstrate the advantages of our method in terms of robustness and computational efficiency. In particular, we investigate the robustness with respect to rotations of images (which can hold up to discretization artifacts) as well as the provable orientation and scaling invariance of 3D point cloud classification.</p>

            <p>There are a wide range of different tokenizers and vocabularies that have been used to train language models, and training a language model on just one of these can be prohibitively expensive. The ability to swap the vocabulary of a model after it has been trained enables models to be adapted to different tokenizers, and even different languages, without the computational or data cost of from-scratch training. In this paper, we ask when such swaps are possible, and how to perform them effectively? The major challenge of performing a vocab swap is re-learning the parameters of the embedding layer for the vocabulary. We observe that it is possible to re-learn the embedding for a vocabulary using a naive initialization, and we investigate strong initialization strategies that enable learning of new embeddings for swapped vocabularies, even when those vocabularies come from a different source language than the original language model.</p>

            <p>Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as a robust technique for improving the accuracy of deep neural networks. However, SAM incurs a high computational cost in practice, requiring up to twice as much computation as vanilla SGD. The computational challenge posed by SAM arises because each iteration requires both ascent and descent steps and thus double the gradient computations. To address this challenge, we propose to compute gradients in both stages of SAM on only the top-k samples with highest loss. K-SAM is simple and extremely easy-to-implement while providing significant generalization boosts over vanilla SGD at little to no additional cost.</p>

            <p>The prevalence of data scraping from social media as a means to obtain datasets has led to growing concerns regarding unauthorized use of data. Data poisoning attacks have been proposed as a bulwark against scraping, as they make data “unlearnable” by adding small, imperceptible perturbations. Unfortunately, existing methods require knowledge of both the target architecture and the complete dataset so that a surrogate network can be trained, the parameters of which are used to generate the attack. In this work, we introduce autoregressive (AR) poisoning, a method that can generate poisoned data without access to the broader dataset. The proposed AR perturbations are generic, can be applied across different datasets, and can poison different architectures. Compared to existing unlearnable methods, our AR poisons are more resistant against common defenses such as adversarial training and strong data augmentations. Our analysis further provides insight into what makes an effective data poison.</p>

            <p>Imperceptible poisoning attacks on entire datasets have recently been touted as methods for protecting data privacy. However, among a number of defenses preventing the practical use of these techniques, early-stopping stands out as a simple, yet effective defense. To gauge poisons’ vulnerability to early-stopping, we benchmark error-minimizing, error-maximizing, and synthetic poisons in terms of peak test accuracy over 100 epochs and make a number of surprising observations. First, we find that poisons that reach a low training loss faster have lower peak test accuracy. Second, we find that a current state-of-the-art error-maximizing poison is 7\texttimes less effective when poison training is stopped at epoch 8. Third, we find that stronger, more transferable adversarial attacks do not make stronger poisons. We advocate for evaluating poisons in terms of peak test accuracy.</p>

            <p>Federated learning (FL) has rapidly risen in popularity due to its promise of privacy and efficiency. Previous works have exposed privacy vulnerabilities in the FL pipeline by recovering user data from gradient updates. However, existing attacks fail to address realistic settings because they either 1) require toy settings with very small batch sizes, or 2) require unrealistic and conspicuous architecture modifications. We introduce a new strategy that dramatically elevates existing attacks to operate on batches of arbitrarily large size, and without architectural modifications. Our model-agnostic strategy only requires modifications to the model parameters sent to the user, which is a realistic threat model in many scenarios. We demonstrate the strategy in challenging large-scale settings, obtaining high-fidelity data extraction in both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning.

            <p>Federated learning is particularly susceptible to model poisoning and backdoor attacks because individual users have direct control over the training data and model updates. At the same time, the attack power of an individual user is limited because their updates are quickly drowned out by those of many other users. Existing attacks do not account for future behaviors of other users, and thus require many sequential updates and their effects are quickly erased. We propose an attack that anticipates and accounts for the entire federated learning pipeline, including behaviors of other clients, and ensures that backdoors are effective quickly and persist even after multiple rounds of community updates. We show that this new attack is effective in realistic scenarios where the attacker only contributes to a small fraction of randomly sampled rounds and demonstrate this attack on image classification, next-word prediction, and sentiment analysis.</p>

            <p>Data poisoning and backdoor attacks manipulate training data to induce security breaches in a victim model. These attacks can be provably deflected using differentially private (DP) training methods, although this comes with a sharp decrease in model performance. The InstaHide method has recently been proposed as an alternative to DP training that leverages supposed privacy properties of the mixup augmentation, although without rigorous guarantees. In this work, we show that strong data augmentations, such as mixup and random additive noise, nullify poison attacks while enduring only a small accuracy trade-off. To explain these finding, we propose a training method, DP-InstaHide, which combines the mixup regularizer with additive noise. A rigorous analysis of DP-InstaHide shows that mixup does indeed have privacy advantages, and that training with k-way mixup provably yields at least k times stronger DP guarantees than a naive DP mechanism. Because mixup (as opposed to noise) is beneficial to model performance, DP-InstaHide provides a mechanism for achieving stronger empirical performance against poisoning attacks than other known DP methods.</p>

            <p>Data poisoning and backdoor attacks manipulate victim models by maliciously modifying training data. In light of this growing threat, a recent survey of industry professionals revealed heightened fear in the private sector regarding data poisoning. Many previous defenses against poisoning either fail in the face of increasingly strong attacks, or they significantly degrade performance. However, we find that strong data augmentations, such as mixup and CutMix, can significantly diminish the threat of poisoning and backdoor attacks without trading off performance. We further verify the effectiveness of this simple defense against adaptive poisoning methods, and we compare to baselines including the popular differentially private SGD (DP-SGD) defense. In the context of backdoors, CutMix greatly mitigates the attack while simultaneously increasing validation accuracy by 9%.</p>

            <p>The adversarial machine learning literature is largely partitioned into evasion attacks on testing data and poisoning attacks on training data.  In this work, we show that adversarial examples, originally intended for attacking pre-trained models, are even more effective for data poisoning than recent methods designed specifically for poisoning. In fact, adversarial examples with labels re-assigned by the crafting network remain effective for training, suggesting that adversarial examples contain useful semantic content, just with the "wrong" labels (according to a network, but not a human). Our method, adversarial poisoning, is substantially more effective than existing poisoning methods for secure dataset release, and we release a poisoned version of ImageNet, ImageNet-P, to encourage research into the strength of this form of data obfuscation.</p>

            <p>Large organizations such as social media companies continually release data, for example user images. At the same time, these organizations leverage their massive corpora of released data to train proprietary models that give them an edge over their competitors. These two behaviors can be in conflict as an organization wants to prevent competitors from using their own data to replicate the performance of their proprietary models. We solve this problem by developing a data poisoning method by which publicly released data can be minimally modified to prevent others from train-ing models on it. Moreover, our method can be used in an online fashion so that companies can protect their data in real time as they release it.We demonstrate the success of our approach onImageNet classification and on facial recognition.</p>

            <p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a widely researched tool for neural architecture search, due to its promising results for image classification. The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture search. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a controlled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be extended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First, the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we conclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from several runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the correlation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3) carefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs of hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.</p>

            <p>Data poisoning is a threat model in which a malicious actor tampers with training data to manipulate outcomes at inference time. A variety of defenses against this threat model have been proposed, but each suffers from at least one of the following flaws: they are easily overcome by adaptive attacks, they severely reduce testing performance, or they cannot generalize to diverse data poisoning threat models. Adversarial training, and its variants, is currently considered the only empirically strong defense against (inference-time) adversarial attacks. In this work, we extend the adversarial training framework to instead defend against (training-time) poisoning and backdoor attacks. Our method desensitizes networks to the effects of poisoning by creating poisons during training and injecting them into training batches. We show that this defense withstands adaptive attacks, generalizes to diverse threat models, and incurs a better performance trade-off than previous defenses.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art adversarial attacks on neural networks use expensive iterative methods and numerous random restarts from different initial points. Iterative FGSM-based methods without restarts trade off performance for computational efficiency because they do not adequately explore the image space and are highly sensitive to the choice of step size. We propose a variant of Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) that uses a random step size to improve performance without resorting to expensive random restarts. Our method, Wide Iterative Stochastic crafting (WITCHcraft), achieves results superior to the classical PGD attack on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets but without additional computational cost. This simple modification of PGD makes crafting attacks more economical, which is important in situations like adversarial training where attacks need to be crafted in real time.</p>

            <p>Matching and partitioning problems are fundamentals of computer vision applications with examples in multilabel segmentation, stereo estimation and optical-flow computation. These tasks can be posed as non-convex energy minimization problems and solved near-globally optimal by recent convex lifting approaches. Yet, applying these techniques comes with a significant computational effort, reducing their feasibility in practical applications. We discuss spatial discretization of continuous partitioning problems into a graph structure, generalizing discretization onto a Cartesian grid. This setup allows us to faithfully work on super-pixel graphs constructed by SLIC or Cut-Pursuit, massively decreasing the computational effort for lifted partitioning problems compared to a Cartesian grid, while optimal energy values remain similar: The global matching is still solved near-globally optimal. We discuss this methodology in detail and show examples in multi-label segmentation by minimal partitions and stereo estimation, where we demonstrate that the proposed graph discretization can reduce runtime as well as memory consumption of convex relaxations of matching problems by up to a factor of 10.</p>

            <p>Energy minimization methods are a classical tool in a multitude of computer vision applications. While they are interpretable and well-studied, their regularity assumptions are difficult to design by hand. Deep learning techniques on the other hand are purely data-driven, often provide excellent results, but are very difficult to constrain to predefined physical or safety-critical models. A possible combination between the two approaches is to design a parametric en- ergy and train the free parameters in such a way that minimizers of the energy correspond to desired solution on a set of training examples. Unfortunately, such formulations typically lead to bi-level optimization problems, on which common optimization algorithms are difficult to scale to modern requirements in data processing and efficiency. In this work, we present a new strategy to optimize these bi-level problems. We investigate surrogate single-level problems that majorize the target problems and can be implemented with existing tools, leading to efficient algorithms without collapse of the energy function. This framework of strategies enables new avenues to the training of parameterized energy minimization models from large data.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel variational approach to estimate the scene flow from RGB-D images. We regularize the ill-conditioned problem of scene flow estimation in a unified framework by enforcing piecewise rigid motion through decomposition into rotational and translational motion parts. Our model crucially regularizes these components by an L0 “norm”, thereby facilitating implicit motion segmentation in a joint energy minimization problem. Yet, we also show that this energy can be efficiently minimized by a proximal primal-dual algorithm. By implementing this approximate L0 rigid motion regularization, our scene flow estimation approach implicitly segments the observed scene of into regions of nearly constant rigid motion. We evaluate our joint scene flow and segmentation estimation approach on a variety of test scenarios, with and without ground truth data, and demonstrate that we outperform current scene flow techniques.</p>

            <p>The minimization of a nonconvex composite function can model a variety of imaging tasks. A popular class of algorithms for solving such problems are majorization-minimization techniques which iteratively approximate the composite nonconvex function by a majorizing function that is easy to minimize. Most techniques, e.g., gradient descent, utilize convex majorizers in order to guarantee that the majorizer is easy to minimize. In our work we consider a natural class of nonconvex majorizers for these functions, and show that these majorizers are still sufficient for a globally convergent optimization scheme. Numerical results illustrate that by applying this scheme, one can often obtain superior local optima compared to previous majorization-minimization methods, when the nonconvex majorizers are solved to global optimality. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of our algorithm for depth superresolution from raw time-of-flight data.</p>

            <p>The idea of video super resolution is to use different view points of a single scene to enhance the overall resolution and quality. Classical energy minimization approaches first establish a correspondence of the current frame to all its neighbors in some radius and then use this temporal information for enhancement. In this paper, we propose the first variational super resolution approach that computes several super resolved frames in one batch optimization procedure by incorporating motion information between the high-resolution image frames themselves. As a consequence, the number of motion estimation problems grows linearly in the number of frames, opposed to a quadratic growth of classical methods and temporal consistency is enforced naturally.We use infimal convolution regularization as well as an automatic parameter balancing scheme to automatically determine the reliability of the motion information and reweight the regularization locally. We demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art results and even is competitive with machine learning approaches.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional time series data from confocal fluorescence microscopes is a valuable tool in biological research, but the data is distorted by Poisson noise and defocus blur of varying axial extent. We seek to obtain structural information about the develop- ment of neural tissue from these images and define a segmentation by an appropriate thresholding of reconstructed data. We model the data degradation and develop a reconstruction formulation based on variational methods. Due to imprecise knowledge of the blur kernel we extend local sparsity regularization to a local patch and use this prior as additional regularization. We show favorable analytical properties for this approach, implement the resulting algorithm with a primal-dual optimization scheme and test on artificial and real data.</p>
