Previous works have exposed privacy vulnerabilities in the FL pipeline by recovering user data from gradient updates. However, existing attacks fail to address realistic settings because they either 1) require a `toy' settings with very small batch sizes, or 2) require unrealistic and conspicuous architecture modifications. We introduce a new strategy that dramatically elevates existing attacks to operate on batches of arbitrarily large size, and without architectural modifications. Our model-agnostic strategy only requires modifications to the model parameters sent to the user, which is a realistic threat model in many scenarios. We demonstrate the strategy in challenging large-scale settings, obtaining high-fidelity data extraction in both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","Computer Science - Machine Learning"],"title":"Fishing for User Data in Large-Batch Federated Learning via Gradient Magnification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liam Fowl","Jonas Geiping","Steven Reich","Yuxin Wen","Wojtek Czaja","Micah Goldblum","Tom Goldstein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646676452,"objectID":"85bcdedf0b33deaf47181edc805e1e81","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/publication/fowl-decepticons-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T18:07:32.394857Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fowl-decepticons-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"A central tenet of Federated learning (FL), which trains models without centralizing user data, is privacy. However, previous work has shown that the gradient updates used in FL can leak user information. While the most industrial uses of FL are for text applications (e.g. keystroke prediction), nearly all attacks on FL privacy have focused on simple image classifiers. We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, and which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, the attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text. This work suggests that FL on text, which has historically been resistant to privacy attacks, is far more vulnerable than previously thought.","tags":["Computer Science - Computation and Language","Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","Computer Science - Machine Learning"],"title":"Decepticons: Corrupted Transformers Breach Privacy in Federated Learning for Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638835200,"objectID":"440f808572e1dfaa4fe56596a17e133d","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/neurips2021/","publishdate":"2021-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/neurips2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Our recent work ”Adversarial Examples Make Strong Poisons” was presented here.

The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture search. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a controlled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be extended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First, the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we conclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from several runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the correlation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3) carefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs of hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science - Machine Learning"],"title":"DARTS for Inverse Problems: A Study on Hyperparameter Sensitivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624492800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624492800,"objectID":"ecdfe53f132ed6386c04fb0f185a9201","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/google2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/google2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Presented and discussed recent work on privacy attacks in Federated Learning.","tags":[],"title":"Google's Privacy Testing Research Meeting","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Liam Fowl","Micah Goldblum","Ping-yeh Chiang","Jonas Geiping","Wojtek Czaja","Tom Goldstein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646676452,"objectID":"713cdff0417dcd6cd4be9cda8bf3f708","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/publication/fowl-adversarial-2021/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T18:07:32.149148Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fowl-adversarial-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The adversarial machine learning literature is largely partitioned into evasion attacks on testing data and poisoning attacks on training data.

Furthermore, when adversarial examples are assigned their adversarial class label, they are useful for training. This suggests that adversarial examples contain useful semantic content, just with the ``wrong'' labels (according to a network, but not a human).

In light of this growing threat, a recent survey of industry professionals revealed heightened fear in the private sector regarding data poisoning.

However, we find that strong data augmentations, such as mixup and CutMix, can significantly diminish the threat of poisoning and backdoor attacks without trading off performance. We further verify the effectiveness of this simple defense against adaptive poisoning methods, and we compare to baselines including the popular differentially private SGD (DP-SGD) defense.

Most commonly, this requirement is addressed by either augmenting the training data, using adversarial training, or defining network architectures that include the desired invariance automatically. Unfortunately, the latter often relies on the ability to enlist all possible transformations, which make such approaches largely infeasible for infinite sets of transformations, such as arbitrary rotations or scaling. In this work, we propose a method for provably invariant network architectures with respect to group actions by choosing one element from a (possibly continuous) orbit based on a fixed criterion. In a nutshell, we intend to 'undo' any possible transformation before feeding the data into the actual network. We analyze properties of such approaches, extend them to equivariant networks, and demonstrate their advantages in terms of robustness as well as computational efficiency in several numerical examples. In particular, we investigate the robustness with respect to rotations of images (which can possibly hold up to discretization artifacts only) as well as the provable rotational and scaling invariance of 3D point cloud classification.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"title":"Training or Architecture?

These attacks can be provably deflected using differentially private (DP) training methods, although this comes with a sharp decrease in model performance. The InstaHide method has recently been proposed as an alternative to DP training that leverages supposed privacy properties of the mixup augmentation, although without rigorous guarantees. In this work, we show that strong data augmentations, such as mixup and random additive noise, nullify poison attacks while enduring only a small accuracy trade-off. To explain these finding, we propose a training method, DP-InstaHide, which combines the mixup regularizer with additive noise. A rigorous analysis of DP-InstaHide shows that mixup does indeed have privacy advantages, and that training with k-way mixup provably yields at least k times stronger DP guarantees than a naive DP mechanism. Because mixup (as opposed to noise) is beneficial to model performance, DP-InstaHide provides a mechanism for achieving stronger empirical performance against poisoning attacks than other known DP methods.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","Computer Science - Machine Learning"],"title":"DP-InstaHide: Provably Defusing Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks with Differentially Private Data Augmentations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liam Fowl","Ping-yeh Chiang","Micah Goldblum","Jonas Geiping","Arpit Bansal","Wojtek Czaja","Tom Goldstein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646676452,"objectID":"a069e2f7c1e6d5ced82889697997b510","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/publication/fowl-preventing-2021/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T18:07:32.660334Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fowl-preventing-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Large organizations such as social media companies continually release data, for example user images.

Adversarial training, and its variants, is currently considered the only empirically strong defense against (inference-time) adversarial attacks. In this work, we extend the adversarial training framework to instead defend against (training-time) poisoning and backdoor attacks. Our method desensitizes networks to the effects of poisoning by creating poisons during training and injecting them into training batches.

These tasks can be posed as non-convex energy minimization problems and solved near-globally optimal by recent convex lifting approaches. Yet, applying these techniques comes with a significant computational effort, reducing their feasibility in practical applications. We discuss spatial discretization of continuous partitioning problems into a graph structure, generalizing discretization onto a Cartesian grid. This setup allows us to faithfully work on super-pixel graphs constructed by SLIC or Cut-Pursuit, massively decreasing the computational effort for lifted partitioning problems compared to a Cartesian grid, while optimal energy values remain similar: The global matching is still solved near-globally optimal. We discuss this methodology in detail and show examples in multi-label segmentation by minimal partitions and stereo estimation, where we demonstrate that the proposed graph discretization can reduce runtime as well as memory consumption of convex relaxations of matching problems by up to a factor of 10.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Mathematics - Optimization and Control"],"title":"Fast Convex Relaxations Using Graph Discretizations","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"1db25fb35c3cdebf06f20e89ac8c71c3","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/siam2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/siam2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Talked about at the SIAM MDS2020 minisymposium ”Learning parameterized energy minimization models” about ”Parametric Majorization for Data-Driven Energy Minimization Methods”.","tags":[],"title":"SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science 2020","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ping-Yeh Chiang","Jonas Geiping","Micah Goldblum","Tom Goldstein","Renkun Ni","Steven Reich","Ali Shafahi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646676452,"objectID":"25a1e8832db3e4f1644759c8e16e443e","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/publication/chiang-witchcraft-2020/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T18:07:31.895287Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chiang-witchcraft-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"State-of-the-art adversarial attacks on neural networks use expensive iterative methods and numerous random restarts from different initial points. Iterative FGSM-based methods without restarts trade off performance for computational efficiency because they do not adequately explore the image space and are highly sensitive to the choice of step size. We propose a variant of Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) that uses a random step size to improve performance without resorting to expensive random restarts. Our method, Wide Iterative Stochastic crafting (WITCHcraft), achieves results superior to the classical PGD attack on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets but without additional computational cost.

By implementing this approximate L0 rigid motion regularization, our scene flow estimation approach implicitly segments the observed scene of into regions of nearly constant rigid motion.

While they are interpretable and well-studied, their regularity assumptions are difficult to design by hand. Deep learning techniques on the other hand are purely data-driven, often provide excellent results, but are very difficult to constrain to predefined physical or safety-critical models. A possible combination between the two approaches is to design a parametric en- ergy and train the free parameters in such a way that minimizers of the energy correspond to desired solution on a set of training examples. Unfortunately, such formulations typically lead to bi-level optimization problems, on which common optimization algorithms are difficult to scale to modern requirements in data processing and efficiency. In this work, we present a new strategy to optimize these bi-level problems. We investigate surrogate single-level problems that majorize the target problems and can be implemented with existing tools, leading to efficient algorithms without collapse of the energy function. This framework of strategies enables new avenues to the training of parameterized energy minimization models from large data.","tags":[],"title":"Parametric Majorization for Data-Driven Energy Minimization Methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"aae836ed73c1a55e3e271f9a144f6c43","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/ifip/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ifip/","section":"talk","summary":"Visited the IFIP TC 7 Conference on System Modelling and Optimization.","tags":[],"title":"IFIP TC 7 Conference on System Modelling and Optimization","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"dc3258394dd125f1823e9de85c3cb206","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/icml2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/icml2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Visited the International Conference on Machine Learning.","tags":[],"title":"International Conference on Machine Learning, 2018","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"f63e17d0b0f33328c6d58e4cebbf7508","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/siam2018/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/siam2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Presented the recent SIAM publication ”Composite Optimization by Nonconvex Majorization-Minimization”","tags":[],"title":"SIAM Conference on Imaging Sciences","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520985600,"objectID":"3c0a6aa3ad3be872160a5c37ef4d22d9","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/siegen2018/","publishdate":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/siegen2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Presented a poster regarding composite nonconvex optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Workshop: Imaging and Vision from Theory to Applications","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"c9616b536e9c9a38453944bce5c92cad","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/gamm2018/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/gamm2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Held a presentation titled ”Composite Optimization by Nonconvex Majorization-Minimization” at the GAMM (German Society for Applied Math and Mechanics) Annual Meeting 2018","tags":[],"title":"GAMM Annual Meeting 2018","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"0947794c1820433821988d2e733d9e3f","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/talk/winteropt/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/winteropt/","section":"talk","summary":"Presented a poster with preliminary work on ”Composite Optimization by Nonconvex Majorization- Minimization” and visited the winter school ”Modern Methods in Nonsmooth Optimization”.","tags":[],"title":"Winter School on Modern Methods in Nonsmooth Optimization","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jonas Geiping","Michael Moeller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646676453,"objectID":"479a10e4de17ceeead3cd2847cfde441","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/publication/geiping-composite-2018/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T18:07:33.656626Z","relpermalink":"/publication/geiping-composite-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The minimization of a nonconvex composite function can model a variety of imaging tasks. A popular class of algorithms for solving such problems are majorization-minimization techniques which iteratively approximate the composite nonconvex function by a majorizing function that is easy to minimize. Most techniques, e.g., gradient descent, utilize convex majorizers in order to guarantee that the majorizer is easy to minimize. In our work we consider a natural class of nonconvex majorizers for these functions, and show that these majorizers are still sufficient for a globally convergent optimization scheme. Numerical results illustrate that by applying this scheme, one can often obtain superior local optima compared to previous majorization-minimization methods, when the nonconvex majorizers are solved to global optimality. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of our algorithm for depth superresolution from raw time-of-flight data.","tags":["90C26; 90C06; 68U10; 32B20; 65K10; 47J06","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Mathematics - Numerical Analysis","Mathematics - Optimization and Control"],"title":"Composite Optimization by Nonconvex Majorization-Minimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Geiping","Hendrik Dirks","Daniel Cremers","Michael Moeller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646676455,"objectID":"75fe9ac2a800ad756fc66fd2608ac2e9","permalink":"https://jonasgeiping.github.io/publication/geiping-multiframe-2018/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T18:07:35.16236Z","relpermalink":"/publication/geiping-multiframe-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The idea of video super resolution is to use different view points of a single scene to enhance the overall resolution and quality.

As a consequence, the number of motion estimation problems grows linearly in the number of frames, opposed to a quadratic growth of classical methods and temporal consistency is enforced naturally.We use infimal convolution regularization as well as an automatic parameter balancing scheme to automatically determine the reliability of the motion information and reweight the regularization locally.
